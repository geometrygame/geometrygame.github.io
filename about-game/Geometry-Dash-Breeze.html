    <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
    <h3>Jumping:</h3>
    <p>Tap the screen on mobile or press the spacebar on PC to make your character jump. In some levels, holding the button will make you jump continuously. Be ready to time your jumps perfectly!</p>

    <h3>Gravity Switching:</h3>
    <p>Some levels have gravity portals that change the direction of gravity. This means you can walk on ceilings or walls! Make sure to pay attention to the gravity direction as you move through these parts.</p>

    <h3>Flying Mode:</h3>
    <p>In certain levels, you’ll get to control a small spaceship in flying mode! Tap or hold the button to make the spaceship fly up, and release to make it go down. Watch out for obstacles while flying!</p>

    <h3>Speed Changes:</h3>
    <p>Speed portals change the speed of the game! They can make you go faster or slower, and you’ll need quick reflexes to keep up with the changes.</p>

    <h3>Checkpoints:</h3>
    <p>Don’t worry if you crash! The game has checkpoints that save your progress. If you crash into an obstacle, you’ll restart from the last checkpoint, so you don’t have to start over from the beginning.</p>
